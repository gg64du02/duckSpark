# sparkDuck

(That is not the best name I came up with, but at least it is not taken or under copyright)

## What is it:

A converter to convert USB rubber ducky's script to digispark code to put in Arduino IDE.

## What you need:

A digispark (duh)

(optionnal) USB extension cord (it will make you life WAY easier especially on laptops)


Those next, you can get on your favorite chinese seller website:

(optionnal) male usb plug to solder to it

(optionnal) empty plastic usb key case that could fit a DigiSpark

(optionnal) tin & soldering iron

(optionnal) Resin or thermo-shapable plastic to secure the male usb plug


## Why:

I found that it would be more easy to use a webpage to convert codes.
No C/C++, sketchy compiled code or python's code. Enjoy.

And why I think people should be aware of this:
